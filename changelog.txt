gpg-remailer (3.04.03)

  * Tony Mancill noticed that some of the files appearing in the standard
    Debian source-files tar shouldn't have been there. Those files were
    removed from this release. No further changes as compared to 3.04.02

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Tue, 07 Nov 2017 19:11:32 +0100

gpg-remailer (3.04.02)

  * Carlo Landmeter noticed that Content-Type and comparable headers were
    missing from the remailer's log file when handling clear-text e-mail.
    This omission was fixed in this release.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sun, 05 Nov 2017 14:19:58 +0100

gpg-remailer (3.04.01)

  * Removed Content-Type and Content-Disposition headers from the original
    e-mail in the reencrypted e-mail: accidentally included at version 3.04.00

  * icmake/precompileheaders was removed, and the build script was adapted
    accordingly. If precompiled headers should not be used comment out the
    line #define PRECOMP in icmconf.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Thu, 05 Oct 2017 16:38:59 +0200

gpg-remailer (3.04.00)

  * Added new option --x-headers (-x). This option inserts X-headers showing
    the original clear text e-mail's `from:', `From:', and headers containing
    'envelope'

  * Removed --std=c++14 from INSTALL.im since that's currenntly the default
    standard.

  * Updated the gpg-remailer/required file

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sun, 24 Sep 2017 14:59:15 +0200

gpg-remailer (3.03.01)

  * New compiler releases required #include <cstring> in cleartextmail.ih.
    No further implementation changes or changes in Gpg-remailer's behavior.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Thu, 31 Aug 2017 16:41:52 +0200

gpg-remailer (3.03.00)

  * Multipart-signed messages may use boundaries consisting of \r\n (and \n,
    and maybe \n\r?). Remailer/copytoboundary.cc now recognizes all three
    forms and uses the actually used separator to separate the various lines
    of the information to copy.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Wed, 10 May 2017 09:02:40 +0200

gpg-remailer (3.02.01)

  * Added documentation/README.flow (primarily for internal use only)

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Wed, 19 Apr 2017 12:26:43 +0200

gpg-remailer (3.02.00)

  * Adapted the icmake scripts to icmake 8.01.00

  * Fixed a bug in handling multipart/signed e-mail handling

  * Correct signatures are not required with gpg-signed e-mail if signature:
    absent has been specified.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Wed, 13 Apr 2016 15:02:07 +0530

gpg-remailer (3.01.03)

  * Added the file extensiveexample.txt covering an extensive example of the
    steps that are involved when operationally using the gpg-remailer.

  * Gpg-remailer displays meaningful error messages for missing numeric option
    arguments (added remailer/strToUnsigned.

  * Adapted the icmake scripts to icmake 8.00.04, updated the installation
    procedure 

  * Fixed a bug in handling log-level specifications

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sun, 20 Dec 2015 12:38:12 +0100

gpg-remailer (3.01.02)

  * Kevin Brodsky observed that the installation scripts used 'chdir' rather
    than 'cd'. Fixed in this release.

  * Kevin Brodsky also observed that the combined size of all precompiled 
    headers might exceed some disks capacities. The option -P was added to the
    ./build script to prevent the use of precompiled headers.

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Mon, 05 Oct 2015 21:22:36 +0200

gpg-remailer (3.01.01)

 * Standardized the (de)installation procedures

 * Gpg-remailer depends on Bobcat >= 4.01.02

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sun, 04 Oct 2015 11:28:28 +0200

gpg-remailer (3.01.00)

  * After Bobcat 3.19.00 Bobcat's class Process can again be used. This
    version drops Spawn in favor of Bobcat's class Process 

  * Added 'build uninstall'. This command only works if, when calling one of
    the 'build install' alternatives and when calling 'build uninstall' the
    environment variable REMAILER contains the (preferably absolute) filename
    of a file on which installed files and directories are logged.
    Note that 'build (dist)clean' does not remove the file pointed at by the
    REMAILER environment variable, unless that file happpens to be in a
    directory removed by 'build (dist)clean'. See also the file INSTALL.
    Defining the REMAILER environment variable as ~/.remailer usually works
    well.

gpg-remailer (3.00.01)

  * Repaired error in exception handling. Because of this, version 3.00.00 is
    not released by itself. Instead, use this 3.00.01 release.

  * Added option --umask

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sun, 15 Dec 2013 14:59:14 +0100

gpg-remailer (3.00.00)

  * The remailer can be configured to accept clear-text messages, in addition
    to GPG/PGP encrypted messages.

  * Added configuration file options `clear-text' ((dis)allowing clear-text
    mail) and `envelope' (specifying from which envelope addresses clear-text
    mail is accepted).

  * The `relax' option and configuration parameter is no longer interpreted. A
    warning is logged if it is used. Instead of using `relax' the pseudo
    account used for remailing should set `umask 077' at shell-startup.

  * Long encrypted messages broke the remailer. Repaired by simplifying child
    process handling in a separate class `Spawn'.

  * Added additional comment to various remailer/ source files, and to
    remailer/remailer.h 

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sat, 14 Dec 2013 13:37:43 +0100

gpg-remailer (2.56.00)

  * Repaired handling of multiple -m or -r options: now all -m and -r options

    address. 

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Thu, 09 Oct 2013 21:27:25 +0200

gpg-remailer (2.55.01)

  * Added missing -pthread flag to icmconf: without it, compiling succeeds,

    V. 3.
