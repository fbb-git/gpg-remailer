Gpg-remailer is somewhat similar to ordinary mailing list software, but all
e-mail processed by gpg-remailer is PGP/GPG signed and encrypted.


Gpg-remailer's repository has moved to https://gitlab.com/fbb-git/gpg-remailer
and is not maintained at this location anymore.

The project's web-page can be found at http://fbb-git.gitlab.io/gpg-remailer
