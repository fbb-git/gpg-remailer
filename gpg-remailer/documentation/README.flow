Using suffix 1 for demo 

main:

            remailer.setFilenames sets all the required file names (in
                    preparations) 

    remailer.preparations(): 
            reads configuration file,
            writes hdrs.1 file, containing all headers, using FBB::MailHeaders
            
    remailer.mailContents():
            writes the contents of the mail to org.1, returning the type
            of the file (UNKNOWN, CLEAR, ENCRYPTED) 

    remailer.decrypt():
            decrypted mail in decrypted.1
            signature in signature.1

    remailer.reencrypt():
            calls fileToReencrypt to process the decrypted file; the latter
            function also sets the correct function to handle encrypted files:
                Remailer::simple,           - simple single encrypted files
                Remailer::multipart,        - multipart files with boundaries
                Remailer::multipartSigned   - multipart files with embedded
                                              signatures.

            then writeReencrypted is called, using d_gpg to reencrypt the
                information for all members.
