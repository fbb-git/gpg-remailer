gpg-remailer NOT YET TAGGED

  * Updated the installation procedure



gpg-remailer (3.01.02)

  * Kevin Brodsky observed that the installation scripts used 'chdir' rather
    than 'cd'. Fixed in this release.

  * Kevin Brodsky also observed that the combined size of all precompiled 
    headers might exceed some disks capacities. The option -P was added to the
    ./build script to prevent the use of precompiled headers.

gpg-remailer (3.01.01)

 * Standardized the (de)installation procedures

 * Gpg-remailer depends on Bobcat >= 4.01.02

gpg-remailer (3.01.00)

  * After Bobcat 3.19.00 Bobcat's class Process can again be used. This
    version drops Spawn in favor of Bobcat's class Process 

  * Added 'build uninstall'. This command only works if, when calling one of
    the 'build install' alternatives and when calling 'build uninstall' the
    environment variable REMAILER contains the (preferably absolute) filename
    of a file on which installed files and directories are logged.
    Note that 'build (dist)clean' does not remove the file pointed at by the
    REMAILER environment variable, unless that file happpens to be in a
    directory removed by 'build (dist)clean'. See also the file INSTALL.
    Defining the REMAILER environment variable as ~/.remailer usually works
    well.

gpg-remailer (3.00.01)

  * Repaired error in exception handling. Because of this, version 3.00.00 is
    not released by itself. Instead, use this 3.00.01 release.

  * Added option --umask

 -- Frank B. Brokken <f.b.brokken@rug.nl>  Sun, 15 Dec 2013 14:59:14 +0100

gpg-remailer (3.00.00)

  * The remailer can be configured to accept clear-text messages, in addition
    to GPG/PGP encrypted messages.

  * Added configuration file options `clear-text' ((dis)allowing clear-text
    mail) and `envelope' (specifying from which envelope addresses clear-text
    mail is accepted).

  * The `relax' option and configuration parameter is no longer interpreted. A
    warning is logged if it is used. Instead of using `relax' the pseudo
    account used for remailing should set `umask 077' at shell-startup.

  * Long encrypted messages broke the remailer. Repaired by simplifying child
    process handling in a separate class `Spawn'.

  * Added additional comment to various remailer/ source files, and to
    remailer/remailer.h

  * NTBSs escaping \- or "-chars were converted to Raw String Literals where
    considered sensible.

    gpg-remailer package are all free software in accordance with the GPL
    V. 3.

  * Updated the man-page

  * Gzipped documents were generated using the -n flag to avoid timestamps
